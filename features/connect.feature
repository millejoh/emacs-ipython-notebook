Scenario: Company completion in a python buffer
  Given I set "ein:completion-backend" to eval "(quote ein:use-company-backend)"
  Given I kill all websocket buffers
  Given new python notebook
  When I open temp file "connect.py"
  And I switch to buffer like "connect.py"
  And I call "python-mode"
  And I connect to default notebook
  And I type "import itertools"
  And I press "RET"
  And I call "ein:connect-run-buffer"
  And I type "itertools."
  And I call "company-complete"
  And I wait for completions "itertools.chain"
  And I press "C-g"
  And I press "RET"
  And I press "RET"
  And I clear websocket log
  And I type "itertool"
  And I call "company-complete"
  Then I should see "itertools"
  And I type ".chai"
  And I call "company-complete"
  Then I should see "itertools.chain"
  Then no completion traffic
