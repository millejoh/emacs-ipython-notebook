;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs IPython Notebook (EIN) lets you run Jupyter (formerly IPython)
;; notebooks within Emacs.  It channels all the power of Emacs without the
;; idiosyncrasies of in-browser editing.
;;
;; No require statements, e.g. ``(require 'ein)``, are necessary, contrary to the
;; `prevailing documentation`_, which should be disregarded.
;;
;; Org_ users please find ob-ein_, a jupyter Babel_ backend.
;;
;; EIN was originally written by `[tkf]`_.  A jupyter Babel_ backend was first
;; introduced by `[gregsexton]`_.
