  ipynb:(:url-or-port \"http://notebook-server\" :name \"My_Notebook\")

Note that spaces will be escaped in org files.

As how IPython development team supports multiple directory in
IPython notebook server is unclear, it is not easy to decide the
format for notebook links.  Current approach is to use
S-expression based (rather verbose) serialization, so that
extending link spec without loosing backward compatibility is
easier.  For the examples of link format in general, see Info
node `(org) External links' and Info node `(org) Search options'"

;; The above expression is evaluated via loaddef file.  At the moment,

;; the above `progn' is executed but still ein-org.el is not loaded.
;; When `ein:org-open' or `ein:org-store-link' is called for opening
;; or storing ipynb link, ein-org.el is loaded finally.  (When
;; ein-org.el is loaded the above expression is evaluated again, but
;; that's OK as the expression is idempotent.)
